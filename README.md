# Zelda_Style_Game
This is a simple game on Python made by pyGame libraries. The main point of this game - is to increase my OOP, code architecture and basic Python skills, and also to take my first step on GameDev :)

To run this game you should copy this repository on your PC using ```git clone``` command and after go to **Engine** start the ```main.py``` file.

Enjoy!
